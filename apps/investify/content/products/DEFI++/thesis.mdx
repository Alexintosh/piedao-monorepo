The PieDAO community has established a set of criteria to determine a project's eligibility for inclusion. The criteria seek to achieve exposure to projects whose tokens have high liquidity, security, and provide real value to holders.

1. **Eligibility criteria for inclusion in PLAY**
2. **Methodology for asset allocation**
3. **Rules and procedure for rebalancing**

The allocation methodology considered for initial reference is the Correlated Risk-Adjusted Market Cap, same as per other PieDAO products, improved by weighting in for each underlying asset the 30 & 15 Day Average Circulating Market Cap, and its 15 Day Average Liquidity on L1 DEXes.
