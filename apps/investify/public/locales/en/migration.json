  "faq2Answer": "<p>The main difference is that, with veDOUGH, users can have multiple locks in the same wallet.<Break>A lock is created when somebody stakes DOUGH for veDOUGH, and expires at a certain point in time. Staking multiple times creates multiple locks, with separate expiry dates.</Break> <Break>veAUXO has a single-lock mechanism. All veAUXO locked by the user will expire at the same time. Additional locked AUXO can be added, and unless specified, this will expire at the same time as existing veAUXO.</Break></p>",

It receives more rewards, can be redeemed for AUXO after the lock expiration, and has the option to exit to its staking derivative (xAUXO) by paying a premium.</Break><Break><b>xAUXO</b> is staking derivative build on top of veAUXO. It is a transferable asset that will allow you to get monthly rewards without the need to participate in governance. Holding a staking derivative and being governance-agnostic has a price: you get fewer rewards compared to veAUXO, and won‚Äôt be able to claim AUXO as the lock does not expire.</Break></p>",

(b) Aggregation can only be done in the wallet that holds the DOUGH locks ‚Äî this is true for veAUXO and xAUXO. (c) Single locking for veAUXO will be possible only on wallets with no DOUGH or AUXO locks. (d) Single locks are migrated in an order determined by the contract: longest locks first.

  "faq5": "What happens if I aggregate all locks?",
  "faq5Answer": "<p>All your DOUGH locks will be merged into one lock. For veAUXO, the new lock duration will be determined by the remaining time to expiration of your longest DOUGH lock (amount of months until its expiration date) ‚Äî impacting the amount of veAUXO received. The end date will be derived from adding the new lock‚Äôs duration to the date you migrated. In case you decide to boost your lock, you will be locking for 36 months and updating the start date to the transaction date. The amount of veAUXO will be the highest in regard to their staking curve.<Break>Examples: (a) You choose to <b>migrate to veAUXO aggregating your locks without boosting</b>. Let‚Äôs consider your longest lock to have 10 months left for expiration. Your new lock in this case will equal to locking AUXO in a new single lock for 10 months and the amount of veAUXO received would be subject to the staking curve for a 10 months commitment. (b) You choose to <b>migrate to veAUXO aggregating your locks and boosting</b>. Let‚Äôs consider your longest lock to have 10 months left for expiration. Your new lock in this case will result in locking AUXO in a new single lock for 36 months with a reset in the start date and the amount of veAUXO received would be equal to locking AUXO for 36 months. (c) You choose to migrate to xAUXO aggregating your locks. The DOUGH on your locks will be migrated to AUXO(100:1 ratio), and you will receive an amount of xAUXO subject to the AUXO:xAUXO ratio (<b>TBD</b>).</Break></p>",

  "faq8": "My locks expire next month, why can I only stake them for 6 months?",

During that process, there‚Äôre three ratios that apply:</p><p><b>DOUGH:AUXO ratio:</b>The DOUGH to AUXO conversion is set at 100:1.
