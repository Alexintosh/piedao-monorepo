Both xAUXO and veAUXO holders will receive rewards, but the veAUXO rewards distributed per token will be higher than the xAUXO rewards per token: reflecting the premium placed on having a liquid token, and not having a need to govern the DAO. In other words, veAUXO holders get 60% of the profit from the Treasury-farmed assets, while xAUXO holders will get proportionally less, as if 40% was distributed instead.</p>",

  "faq16Answer": "<p>veAUXO token holders will benefit from direct on-chain governance capabilities and their share will enable them to vote and govern the DAO. For veAUXO holders voting is an action required to be eligible for the monthly rewards distribution. On the other hand, xAUXO holders do not benefit from these governance capabilities, as they delegate the work to the veAUXO holders as part of the trade-off for being liquid.

  "faq17": "Transfer",
  "faq17Answer": "<p>veAUXO is a non-transferable token, meaning that it will stay in the wallet chosen until the lock is over and can be unlocked and redeemed for AUXO.
