  "faq8Answer": "<p>The duration of non-boosted locks migrated to ARV are determined by the remaining time to expiration of your longest vDOUGH lock (amount of months until its expiration date).

  "faq13Answer": "<p>DOUGH will always be with us ‚Äî yet it won‚Äôt serve any purpose in the Auxo DAO.

  "faq15": "Rewards",
  "faq15Answer": "<p>Every month the DAO Treasury will distribute rewards to ARV and PRV stakers that come from the Treasury Farming operations. Both PRV and ARV holders will receive rewards, but the ARV rewards distributed per token will be higher than the PRV rewards per token: reflecting the premium placed on having a liquid token, and not having a need to govern the DAO. In other words, ARV holders get 60% of the profit from the Treasury-farmed assets, while PRV holders will get proportionally less, as if 40% was distributed instead.</p>",
  "faq16": "Governance",
  "faq16Answer": "<p>ARV token holders will benefit from direct on-chain governance capabilities and their share will enable them to vote and govern the DAO. For ARV holders voting is an action required to be eligible for the monthly rewards distribution. On the other hand, PRV holders do not benefit from these governance capabilities, as they delegate the work to the ARV holders as part of the trade-off for being liquid. Instead of voting, PRV holders require to stake their token in order to be eligible for the monthly rewards distribution.</p>",
  "faq17": "Transfer",
  "faq17Answer": "<p>ARV is a non-transferable token, meaning that it will stay in the wallet chosen until the lock is over and can be unlocked and redeemed for AUXO. In comparison, PRV is a transferable token that can be transferred freely, as it‚Äôs a liquid staking derivative of ARV.</p>",

  "faq19": "Bonding",
  "faq19Answer": "<p>AUXO introduces a way for ARV holders to create recurring liquidity events, also known as bonding, in order to increase treasury principal by minting tokens. Bonding to ARV always happens at the exact NAV price, while bonding to PRV is subject to premium (TBD) ‚Äî in consequence bonding to PRV increases the NAV price.</p>",
  "faq20": "Mint fee",
  "faq20Answer": "<p>There are no fees associated with minting ARV tokens. On the contrary, a mint fee (<b>20%</b>) may be applied when PRV is minted.</p>",
  "faq21": "Exit",
  "faq21Answer": "<p>ARV can only be exited at lock expiration. PRV can‚Äôt be exited but traded. At any given point in time, ARV can be locked in perpetuity by minting PRV (minting fee applies), and PRV then traded to exit the position.</p>",
