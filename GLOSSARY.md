## Pie Vaults

PieVaults are a brand new product type fresh from the PieDAO bakery.

They unlock many new possibilities and features as PieVaults are able to directly interact with smart-contracts and DeFi protocols.

PieVaults will initially launch with three core features: meta-governance, yield-bearing assets and asset lending.

## Pie Smart Pools

Pie Smart Pools are non-custodial smart contracts, the first implementation of a DAO-governed AMM pool. They add extra functionality on top of vanilla AMMs pools.

Providing liquidity to one of these Pies gets you tokenized exposure to the underlying assets and additionally generates yield from the liquidity in these pools to perform token swaps.

The Pie Smart Pools are asset management agnostic. At the time of writing, Pie Smart Pools are compatible with the Balancer interface.
